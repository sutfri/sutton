          <b>ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS</b>
        </div>
        <div id="left-right-top">
            <i>“Hello my name is _______ and I’m an alcoholic”</i>, this is how every “share” started. Immediately, I was confronted with the seriousness and weight of the topic at hand. I attend the "Never Too Young Alcoholics Anonymous" meeting, which is catered towards alcoholics in generation-z. Therefore, I found myself identifying with many of the members.<br>
            <br>
            Prior to the AA meeting, I knew a little about addiction because the disease is no stranger to my family. With my minor experience in this subject, I related much to a member’s story. He was a high-functioning alcoholic. A high-functioning alcoholic drinks excessively, yet is still able to be a productive member of society. With this in mind, they are still an alcoholic because of their excessive drinking and the distress that follows consequently. Although I do not suffer with this illness myself, my father does, and his brother, and their father; therefore, I can assume there is a genetic correlation relating to addiction. Because of this, I believe I am at high risk of developing an addiction, so I don’t tempt my self-will when it comes to substances such as alcohol.<br>
            <br>
            Another aspect of a high-functioning alcoholic is a strain on their relationships. Although they may thrive in a work setting, they often struggle with forming meaningful bonds with those around them. This is because they prioritize alcohol over everyone else. A member at the meeting described this loneliness by stating that drinking is an attempt to ‘fill a hole in our soul’.  She developed this idea further by comparing internal problems and external problems. Drinking is an internal problem: it is an illness caused by a dissatisfaction in the drinker’s self. Whereas, an external problem, which alcoholics tend to use as an excuse for their behavior, is anything that the drinker cannot control. ‘Drinking wasn’t the problem, everything else was.’ This is comparable to the struggle of internal and external loci of control. Once the addict gains the internal locus control perspective, they are much more willing to seek help. I believe that this logic applies to almost every plight; how can we expect to change if we don’t recognize the problem within ourselves first?<br>
            <br>
            Because of the lack of relationships many alcoholics struggle with, a major aspect of AA meetings is creating community. ‘Don’t be weirded out by how friendly everyone is when you first join AA’, one member was warned before she first started coming to meetings nearly five years ago. Moreover, it is encouraged to find a sponsor as soon as possible. A sponsor, regarding AA, is a senior member of AA who understands first hand the struggle of addiction. It is incredibly beautiful how safe of a space the meetings can be for struggling addicts, and the supportive community that comes along with it. Yet, it is incredibly unfortunate that this is not the norm in our everyday society. There certainly needs to be more public support and less stigmatized public opinion regarding those with addiction. This is indispensable because it takes a lot of support and bravery to take the first step of recovery, which is admitting you have a problem.<br>
            <br>
            When leaving the meeting, I felt immense guilt. Once I walk out those doors, I’m done, but the members are not ‘done’; this is their lives, and they have to live with this for their entire lives. To add, I feel guilty about using their experiences purely to write this essay. Although their stories also added to my perception of what addiction is, I can’t help but feel like I exploited their plight for my pages. To conclude, it was unsettling to identify with the members so much because of the universal experiences that come along with our shared age, yet recognize the distance in our developments.<br>
